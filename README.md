Bio-Link Agent is an **agentic research assistant** that bridges the gap between retrospective evidence and prospective clinical action through natural language processing, knowledge graphs, and semantic search.

The system supports two key personas:
- 🩺 **Clinician** → Match patients to relevant clinical trials using semantic similarity
- 🔬 **Researcher** → Build and explore disease-specific knowledge graphs from biomedical literature

Built with: **NLP** • **MCP Tools** • **Neo4j** • **Vector Search** • **RAG**

## 🎯 Overview

Bio-Link Agent addresses a critical challenge in clinical research: connecting the right patients to the right trials while helping researchers navigate the complex landscape of biomedical literature.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Semantic Trial Matching**: Goes beyond keyword matching to understand patient descriptions in natural language
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Automatically builds structured representations of diseases, drugs, targets, and biomarkers
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Combines PubMed literature with ClinicalTrials.gov data
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Applies hard eligibility criteria (age, sex, location) before semantic ranking

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🩺 **Clinician: Patient-Level Trial Matching**

The **Semantic Trial Matcher** helps clinicians find relevant trials for their patients through an MCP tool interface.

**Input Parameters:**
- **Condition**: Primary diagnosis (e.g., "lung cancer", "COPD")
- **Patient Note**: Free-text description of symptoms, history, prior treatments
- **Age**: Patient age in years (optional)
- **Sex**: Male/female/all (optional)
- **Country**: Patient location (optional)

**Processing Pipeline:**
1. Fetches active trials from ClinicalTrials.gov
2. Applies hard eligibility filters:
   - Age range compatibility
   - Sex eligibility
   - Geographic availability
3. Computes semantic similarity between:
   - Patient description
   - Trial inclusion/exclusion criteria
4. Ranks trials by match score

**Output:**
- Match score (0-1)
- Trial title & NCT ID
- Eligibility summary
- Link to trial registry
- Relevant matched snippet from eligibility criteria

**Solving Vocabulary Mismatch:**  
Patient language: *"winded and extremely tired"*  
→ Medical terminology: **dyspnea + fatigue**

---

### 🔬 **Researcher: Landscape Graph Builder**

Constructs a disease-specific knowledge graph from biomedical data sources.

**Data Sources:**
- PubMed abstracts
- ClinicalTrials.gov trial protocols

**Graph Schema:**

**Nodes:**
- Diseases
- Subtypes
- Drugs
- Targets / Genes
- Biomarkers
- Outcomes
- Trials
- Papers

**Relationships:**
```cypher
DISEASE -[:HAS_SUBTYPE]-> SUBTYPE
DRUG -[:TARGETS]-> GENE
TRIAL -[:TESTS]-> DRUG
BIOMARKER -[:MEASURED_IN]-> TRIAL
PAPER -[:MENTIONS]-> DISEASE
DRUG -[:TREATS]-> DISEASE
```

**Visualization:**  
Interactive Neo4j-powered graph exploration through Streamlit UI

---

### 🧠 **(Planned) Research Q&A with KG + Vector RAG**

Combining structured graph queries with unstructured text retrieval for intelligent question answering.

**Approach:**
- Index curated papers + trials into vector store
- Answer questions using:
  - Neo4j sub-graph queries (relationships & hierarchies)
  - Vector-based retrieval from topic corpus
  - LLM synthesis over both signals

**Example Queries:**
- *"Which biomarkers are being tested in KRAS-mutant NSCLC trials?"*
- *"What are the major evidence gaps between published work and active trials?"*
- *"What drugs target EGFR exon 20 insertions?"*

**Output Format:**  
Text answer + visual sub-graph for reasoning transparency

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Neo4j Aura account (or local Neo4j instance)
- PubMed API access (requires email registration)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Bio-Link-Agent-NLP.git
cd Bio-Link-Agent-NLP
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac / Linux
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (copy from `.env.example` if available):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env with your actual credentials
```

Or create `.env` manually with:

```ini
# PubMed API Configuration
PUBMED_EMAIL=your.email@domain.com

# Neo4j Aura Credentials
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+ssc://<instance>.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=<your-password>
NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
```

⚠️ **Important**: The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` - never commit credentials!

### 5. Verify Setup

Run the test script to verify everything is configured correctly:

```bash
python test_setup.py
```

This will check:
- All dependencies are installed
- Clients can be initialized
- Vector store works
- Environment variables are set
- Neo4j connection (if configured)
- Router functionality (if Ollama is set up)
